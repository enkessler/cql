todo - organize feature files for better presentation on Relish
todo - Change clauses to target based on final attribute names (i.e. after 'as' clause) instead of original attribute name (which may contain duplicate selections resulting in ambiguity)
todo - Possible new feature: 'order_by' clause. Would allow ordering of the results set based on an attribute (i.e. select target) and could take a block for sorting (probably passed right on to Ruby's Array sorting method). No real need for it yet but could be a useful exercise for teaching someone.
